## Ray traycing

School project on raytracing. The following image shows a mirror sphere and a glass sphere inside a box (Cornel box like setup).
Structure code and png generator were given and I have implemented raycast on square, sphere and mesh as well as reflexion and refraction computation.

## Group project : Engine

Objectives of this assignment : Code from scratch an engine that enable a controler to move inside en environment. COVID19 has forced us to revise downwards our goals, but we were able to provide a demo. The engine feature random generate terrain, grass, trees and collisions.

# Unity Projects

All the following projects are far from actual games. They only show my progress learning Unity from scratch on my own. As so, they can all be labled as "Work in progress".

## Dungeon Platform
The idea behind this small game was a platform game with an Indiana Jones vibe and dark dungeon such as one that can be found in Elder Scrolls games.

## Dice Tower
I wanted a small project that could be ended quickly. As a fan of tabletop rpg, dice tower are often used, and I thought it could be nice to create one in Unity.
This project help me to learn a bit on ProBuilder.

## CrossLine

This project was to try 2D in Unity. I have discovered a mini game in World of Warcraft that I enjoyed and I tried to implement it.
