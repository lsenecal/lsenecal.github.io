## Group project : Engine

Objectives of this assignment : To code from scratch an engine that enables the controler to move inside en environment. COVID19 has forced us to set less ambitious goals, but we were able to provide a demo. The engine feature randomly generate terrain, grass, trees and collisions. My contribution was focus on the Physics Engine.

## Bézier Curve Editor

This project initially started as a school assignment that I have decided to advance further. This small editor makes it possible to add control points to a curve and also click and drag these control points.

## Ray traycing

School project on raytracing: The following image shows a mirror sphere and a glass sphere inside a box (Cornel box like setup). A structure code and png generator were given and I have implemented raycast on the square, sphere and mesh as well as reflexion and refraction computation.

# Unity Projects

All the following projects are far from actual games. However, they demonstrate my progress in learning Unity from scratch. As so they can all be labled as “Work in progress”.

## Dungeon Platform
The idea behind this small game was a platform game with an Indiana Jones vibe with a dark dungeon like the one that can be found in Elder Scrolls games.

## Dice Tower
I wanted a small project that could be ended quickly. As a fan of tabletop rpg, dice towers are often used, and I thought it could be nice to create one in Unity. This project helped me to learn a little of ProBuilder.

## Strategy Test
This is a really early project of a strategy wargame such as Warhammer. This demo mainly serves as a test place.

## CrossLine

This project was to try 2D in Unity. I have discovered a mini game in World of Warcraft which I enjoyed and I have tried to recreate it here.
