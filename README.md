# Unity

Why choose Unity ? For two main reason : 

First of all, it is free of charge. A major pro when your are a student.
And secondly, Unity possess a vast community with a lot of assets for self learning.

# Projects

All the following projects are far from actual game. They only show my progress learning Unity from scratch on my own. As so, they can all lable "Work in progress".

## Dungeon Plateform
The idea behind the small game was a platefrom game with an Indiana Jones vibe and dark dungon such as one that can be found in Elder Scrolls games.
