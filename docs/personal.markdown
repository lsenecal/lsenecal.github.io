# Unity projects

All the following projects are far from actual games. However, they demonstrate my progress in learning Unity from scratch. As so they can all be labled as “Work in progress”.

## Dungeon Platform
The idea behind this small game was a platform game with an Indiana Jones vibe with a dark dungeon like the one that can be found in Elder Scrolls games.

## Dice Tower
I wanted a small project that could be ended quickly. As a fan of tabletop rpg, dice towers are often used, and I thought it could be nice to create one in Unity. This project helped me to learn a little of ProBuilder.

## Strategy Test
This is a really early project of a strategy wargame such as Warhammer. This demo mainly serves as a test place.

## CrossLine

This project was to try 2D in Unity. I have discovered a mini game in World of Warcraft which I enjoyed and I have tried to recreate it here.
