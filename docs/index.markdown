Welcome to my GitHub page !

Iâ€™m Luc, C++ programmer and video games player.

I used to work in computational physics but have recently refocused my attention to game programming.

I haven't left everything behind because I'm interested in physics-based rendering and collision detection.

Hope you will find what you seek here.

Cheers !
