Welcome to my GitHub page !

I’m Luc, C++ programmer and video games player.

I used to work in computational physics but recently refocus my attention to game programming.

I didn’t leave everythings behind as I am interrrested in physics based rendering and collisions detection.

Hope you will find what you seek here.

Cheers !
