Intially a school project that I decided to push further. This small editor enables to add control points to the curve and click and drag these control points. It uses OpenGL.

## Ray traycing

School project on raytracing. Image shows a mirror sphere and a glass sphere inside a box (Cornel box like setup).
Structure code and png generator was given. I have implemented raycast on square, sphere and mesh as well as reflexion and refraction computation.

## Group project : Engine

Objectif : Code from scratch an engine that enable a controler to move inside en environment. COVID19 put donw our objectives, but we were able to provide a demo.

# Unity Projects

All the following projects are far from actual game. They only show my progress learning Unity from scratch on my own. As so, they can all be labled as "Work in progress".

## Dungeon Plateform
The idea behind the small game was a platefrom game with an Indiana Jones vibe and dark dungon such as one that can be found in Elder Scrolls games.

## Dice Tower
I wanted a small project that could be end quicly. As a fan of tabletop rpg, dice tower as often use, and I thought it could be nice to create one in Unity.
This project help me to learn a bit on ProBuilder.

## CrossLine

This project was to try 2D in Unity. I really enjoy a mini game used in World of Warcraft and tried to implement it.
