## Ray traycing

School project on raytracing. The following image shows a mirror sphere and a glass sphere inside a box (Cornel box like setup).
Structure code and png generator were given. I have implemented raycast on square, sphere and mesh as well as reflexion and refraction computation.

# Unity Projects

All the following projects are far from actual game. They only show my progress learning Unity from scratch on my own. As so, they can all be labled as "Work in progress".

## Dungeon Platform
The idea behind the small game was a platform game with an Indiana Jones vibe and dark dungon such as one that can be found in Elder Scrolls games.

## Dice Tower
I wanted a small project that could be end quicly. As a fan of tabletop rpg, dice tower as often use, and I thought it could be nice to create one in Unity.
This project help me to learn a bit on ProBuilder.
