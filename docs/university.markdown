# Group project : Game Engine

Objectives of this assignment : To code from scratch an engine that enables the controler to move inside en environment. COVID19 has forced us to set less ambitious goals, but we were able to provide a demo. The engine feature randomly generate terrain, grass, trees and collisions. My contribution was focus on the Physics Engine.

# Ray traycing

School project on raytracing: The following image shows a mirror sphere and a glass sphere inside a box (Cornel box like setup). A structure code and png generator were given and I have implemented raycast on the square, sphere and mesh as well as reflexion and refraction computation.

# BÃ©zier Curve Editor

This project initially started as a school assignment that I have decided to advance further. This small editor makes it possible to add control points to a curve and also click and drag these control points.
